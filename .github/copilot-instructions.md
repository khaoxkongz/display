Whenever proposing a file use the file block syntax.
Files must be represented as code blocks with their `name` in the header.
Example of a code block with a file name in the header:

```typescript name=filename.ts
contents of file
```

For Markdown files, you must use four opening and closing backticks (````) to ensure that code blocks inside are escaped.
Example of a code block for a Markdown file:

````markdown name=filename.md
`code block inside file`
````
